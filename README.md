Layout plan, electronics and such for the model railroad in KSP room at our university.

The train has a microcontroller on board and therefore can do lots of fun stuff. See electronics.md.
Notes
-----

- pay attention to the physical & electrical connections when laying down the tracks!
  - esp. at turnouts/crossings
    - do we have turnouts, and how do they work electrically anyway?
  - do we have flexible tracks?
  - note: stick to <= 2% climb
- power
  - how much current?
  - auxiliary stuff (think about what auxiliary stuff we'll need)
  - trains: variable DC (voltage => speed), or pulse (half of an AC wave)
    - pulse helps overcome friction and such, but heat => only for low speeds (but we don't want high speeds anyway)
  - note: standard is + on the right :D
